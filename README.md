This is a very simple app that is supposed to be able to
host a variety of alarms that will go off whenever you
want them to. Will eventually be availiable on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

As a further goal for this project, I want it to be able to connect to the
internet and to work on all machines logged on to this program.

- Started the repository
- Nothing really works, atm.
- Just a barebones Tkinter app. Will add more.
